# basic_budget

I am currently in the process of buying a home and have been doing a lot of the same calculations over and over. So, thought I would build a calculator/budget program.

Note: Still a work in progress. No design. Just raw data. Will probably make it look nicer at later stages. 

Questions this program will answer for you:

How much of a down payment can you afford?
If you can't afford it now, when will you be able to?

Open up the console and type in:

home(savings, costOfHome, downPayment)

savings: How much you have in savings.

costOfHome: Total cost of the home.

downPayment: How much money you are willing/able to put down. Defaults to 20%. But can be changed to something more or less.
